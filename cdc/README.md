This folder contains data from the CDC WONDER "Underlying Cause of Death" & "Multiple Cause of Death (Provisional)" datasets available from [wonder.cdc.gov](https://wonder.cdc.gov/)

Do note the Data Use Restrictions for using WONDER data, specifically:
>"Do not present or publish death counts of 9 or fewer or death rates based on counts of nine or fewer (in figures, graphs, maps, tables, etc.)."

All visualizations in this folder derived from WONDER data will comply with this and all other Use Restrictions

When data points are missing, such as when certain States are missing from maps, it is generally because of these restrictions
